## src
`base.ink.svg` represents the main version of our logo.
In addition to the main version, the file also contains some variations that can be build using the make script.

In order to be able to permanently use those colors in Inkscape you have to save the .gpl file in the corresponding resource directory.
E.g.: `/usr/share/inkscape/palettes/foss-ag.gpl`
